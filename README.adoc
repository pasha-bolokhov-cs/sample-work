Samples and demos of web development projects

The projects displayed in this portfolio provide a sample of coding experience.
While this is by no means a complete history of my programming experience,
these projects emphasize a number of important points.
While specific features and skills are shown under each project, all of them
emphasize a number of important characteristics:

* The importance of finding the most efficient/elegant solutions, at the time of writing the code
* Modern programming/web features, at the time of writing the code
* Ability to quickly learn new materials, programming languages, techniques, frameworks and efficiently use them in the code
* Consistency and strong programming style.
  This includes writing clean code and supplying comments
* Ability to keep a consistent Git repository or mono–repository.
  Clean atomic transactional commits, feature branches

== &#x1f30e; Albatross Online Store — Feature Project

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasha-bolokhov/sample-work/master/albatross/albatross-packages.png[link=https://albatross-travel-agency.web.app]

[NOTE]
This is the Angular version of a class project presented further below, which was originally written with AngularJS.
The current project is still under development.
It uses techniques and features that are significantly newer and are at the leading edge of web technology.
While the project is available to browse, please note that it is in a very raw state,
with significant improvements pending to its UI, themes, loading experiences and so on

The project is being migrated to the modern *Angular*. It features the techniques and methods that come with Angular — Material Design, Routing, Lazy Loading, Differential Loading.
The project is completely serverless, instead making use of Google Firebase microservices such as Firebase Auth, Firestore, Storage, Hosting and Functions.
This version of the project is designed to be fully responsive.
A very raw progress can be previewed on the project's https://albatross-travel-agency.web.app[Firebase hosting], where it is deployed from its https://gitlab.com/pasha-bolokhov/albatross[Gitlab repository] using GitLab's CI/CD pipelines

I am providing a reference to the modernized version of the App, as a demonstration of

* the ability to follow the modern technology
* the ability to quickly learn new frameworks and tools
* skills in the serverless approach

Needless to say that for practical purposes, Angular is an entirely "different" framework (compared with AngularJS), with a very thorough and systematic approach to creating a multi-component app.
To begin with, it uses *Typescript* as the main language, and has a very large documentation base.
With it come many features which were not available just a few years ago — Server Side Rendering, Progressive Web Apps, Lazy Loading and many more — with ease.
Besides Promises (now native), it uses *Observables* as the main approach to reactive programming.
Observables are most effectively demontrated by seeing how changes to a database instantly propagate to the view of the app — no hooks or callbacks involved.
Angular *Routing* provides a systematic way of splitting both the business logic and the view of the app into components, and of seamlessly switching between these components (while a "navigation bar" is just the simplest example of this, the router allows for a significantly deeper integration between the state of the app and its view — with deep-linking into all "components" of the state of the app)

*Firebase* ecosystem provides an easy route to the modern and fast *serverless* technology.
This technology gives a highly-scalable approach,
where the common tasks are performed by the associated Firebase services.
The new Albatross app does not have Back End in its traditional sense,
nor does it have a traditional database.
Instead, it involves

* Firebase Auth for user authentication (including provider-based authentication with Google, Facebook, Microsoft _etc_).
  Authentication and the related security issues are no longer a problem for the app
* Firebase Hosting for serving the app. Deployment is done via CI/CD pipelines
* Firebase Storage for storing large static resources such as images
* Firestore as an ultra-modern, real-time and extremely scalable NoSQL database.
  While in general NoSQL has been the trend of the last few years, it typically suffers the "denormalization" problem, needed to address in order to provide high-availability data services efficiently.
  However, with Firestore _shallow queries_, denormalization is not always necessary

* Firestore has rôle-based *access rules*, which provide a simple and yet rock-solid approach
to authorization. Rules are effectively separated from the logic of the rest of the "back-end",
minimizing chances of an error
* Firebase Cloud Functions which are the analogy of the rôle of the traditional "back-end" approach.
Cloud functions are NodeJS-based services, which are triggered by specific conditions or events.
They run to keep the database properly organized, and also serve as API access points

Feel free to log onto the hosted version of the new app (links are available above), scout, create an account (or log in with a provider-based account) and assess its features. Many of the features are not visible "by touch", and can only be seen in the code.
Again, please note that the app is still under development.
In particular, colour themes and palettes and some layouts are temporary

This is the original version of the Albatross Project written in 2015.
The code is hosted at https://gitlab.com/pasha-bolokhov/albatross-travel[Albatross Project] webpage.
The running LEMP version is available on this
https://albatross-travel-app.herokuapp.com[Heroku] instance.

[NOTE]
This is originally a _class_ project featuring multiple frameworks and services — AngularJS, Bootstrap, JWT, MySQL, PayPal (sandbox) _etc_

This project demonstrates the skills of both Front End and Back End programming,
ability to efficiently plan the project and collaborate and lead the programming team.
This was a course project at the Camosun College's Computer Systems Technology program.
At the time of creation, it used the most popular frameworks (AngularJS, Bootstrap) for the Front End.
The code available to browse, emphasizes the ability to learn new features, significantly exceeding the College's program.
At the time of writing the code, the courses had covered basic HTML/CSS, basic Javascript, and basic PHP, and MySQL.
Single Page Apps, REST API and responsive design were not even close to be taught.
Neither were Git, GitHub and the related aspects of code versioning.
My rôle was — to discover and educate myself on the leading-edge frameworks, to set up a virtual machine for hosting the app, and to educate and lead the team of developers

The most significant feature of this app (at the time of developing) was AngularJS.
While outdated these days, it was a leading edge and perhaps the most powerful approach to Single Page Apps.
Using AngularJS involved a number of features by itself. A few examples of them are Promises (not yet part of Javascript), UI Router, state management, form validation (front-end), JWT, and many others

The back-end part of this project was at the same time a simple REST API implementation written in PHP with MySQL as the database.
The scheme of the database had to be thoroughly prepared, as such was the requirement of the course.
The database represents the normalized structure of client's data (personal data, purchases) as well as that of the list of products (components, relations between the components _etc_)

Feel free to browse this project, use a mock email address to sign up and log in. Please note that mobile UX was not a requirement for this project at the time (2015)

== &#x1f30e; Internal proprietary analytics website

[IMPORTANT]
====
A web-based company's business-related information (terminology, identifiers, comments) is blacked-out in the code

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasha-bolokhov/sample-work/master/analytics/analytics-banner.png[link=https://github.com/pasha-bolokhov-cs/sample-work/tree/master/analytics]


This was a contract project with Belkasoft, where statistical data analysis related to client activity had to be implemented and displayed on an internal website.
The website is running Perl(Catalyst) with a MySQL database.
My duty consisted of the whole implementation of the task, starting from the Front End (for which I decided to use AngularJS with Material Design), to the Back End, where the actual calculations and REST API had to be done.
I chose Google Charts as a third-party tool for graphical representation of the results

The website is shown on picture
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasha-bolokhov/sample-work/master/analytics/analytics-screenshot.png[Request Analytics Screenshot].

The relevant "de-classified" code is at
https://github.com/pasha-bolokhov-cs/sample-work/tree/master/analytics[Request Analytics Code].

I am providing this reference as a demonstration of

* the ability to find and exploit the most efficient services (Google Charts in this case)
* skills in implementing REST API

== &#x1f30e; Slope-It Google Sheets Add-on

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pasha-bolokhov/sample-work/master/slope-it/slope-it-screenshot.png[link=https://slope-it-tool.web.app]

This is an add-on for statistical calculations in Google Sheets.
It is installable via its https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/slopeit/1088613043056[G Suite Marketplace] listing

This app assists students in their routine tasks during the laboratory.
Such tasks are relatively easy to perform, but are tedious, and prone to errors.
This app does such calculations quickly and effectively, providing a convenient interface

The add-ons for Google Docs are written in App Script (Javascript).
The main part of the app constitutes the Back End (since it has read/write access to Google Docs).
The UI elements that are built on top of Google Docs constitute the Front End.
Front End functions are able to call the Back End functions

Publishing the app is a long process, involving the design of logo and promo images, registration and verification of accounts and so on (without publishing, only the owner is able to use the app, unless the owner "shares" it with others).
As with other installable apps, clients need to grant the app access to their documents.
This requires verification of the developer by Google

I am presenting this app as a demonstration of

* the ability to learn proprietary framework
* the ability to publish an app in a popular marketplace
